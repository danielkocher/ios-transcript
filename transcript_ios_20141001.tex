\section*{Myth Busting}

\begin{mb}
	\myth{I prefer programming language X because it makes it more convinient to implement my application.}
	\answer{Wrong!}
\end{mb}

\par{
	\noindent
	The fundamental problem of programming is to establish functional \underline{correctness} and adequate \underline{performance}. Different languages provide different tools of automating the process of establishing correctness and performance. The language should be chosen based on that insight.

\begin{mb}
	\myth{I like garbage-collected languages like Java because they free me from memory management.}
	\answer{Wrong!}
\end{mb}

\par{
	\noindent
	A garbage collector (GC) provides safe deallocation of unneeded memory but the programmer still needs to say what is unneeded, otherwise the system will run out of memory (memory leak).

\subsection*{Sequential vs. Parallelized Code}

\par{
	\noindent
	The bottleneck of parallelized is the memory bus. It is limiting execution even if a problem can be perfectly parallelized without any side effects. Thus a parallelization factor of 100\% is infeasible. Any shared resource at any level of an architecture creates a limitation.
