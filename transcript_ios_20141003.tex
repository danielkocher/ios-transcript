	C* is a Turing-complete language:
	\parskip0pt
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{arithmetics or integer}
		\item{dereferencing operator}
		\item{assignment}
		\item{while loops}
	\end{itemize}
	Functions are not needed to satisfy Turing-completeness but reduces the size of code by preventing code duplication.
}

\par{
	\noindent
	In general, every if-else-construct can be replaced by while loops, but not the other way round. However, a while loop can be replaced by a combination of functions and if-else-constructs for Turing-completeness.
}

\subsection*{Functions}

\par{
	\noindent
	Why do we use a stack and no other data structure? Because a stack guarantees proper nesting of functions, constant time access and has no spatial drawback. These facts are a result of the LIFO (Last In First Out) property of a stack.

\par{
	\noindent
	\texttt{<faddr>} is often resolved by a part of the compiler called \textit{Linker}. There may be two kinds of references: symbolic references (e.g. \texttt{f}, the name of the function) and direct references (e.g. \texttt{addr(f)}, the absolute address of the function in memory).

	\underline{Caller vs. Callee:}
	\par{
		\noindent
		The caller of a function \texttt{f} invokes the function, e.g. \texttt{f(x);}. \newline
		The callee is the function itself, e.g. \texttt{int f(int x) \{ ... \}}. \newline
		The callee can again be a caller if it invokes another function in its body, \newline e.g. \texttt{int f(int x) \{ ... g(x); ... \}}.
	}

\par{
	\noindent
	\underline{Declaration vs. Definition:}
	\par{
		\noindent	
		A declaration is inserted into the symbol table of a compiler, e.g. \texttt{int x;}. The declaration tells the compiler that a variable or function exists. \newline
		A definition is the actual value assignment, e.g. \texttt{x = 2;}. A definition can be done multiple times in a source code.

\subsection*{Heap}

\par{
	\noindent
	Dynamically allocated memory is located on the heap. In C there is the \texttt{malloc}/\texttt{free} combination to accomplish this, in Java there is the \texttt{new} keyword to allocate memory dynamically but no explicit mechanism to deallocate it. Java has a garbage collector which safely deallocates unneeded memory. However, Java provides implicit deallocation mechanisms. The first is to set a reference explicitely to null:
	\begin{verbatim}
        x = new A(); // dynamic allocation
        ...
        ...
        x = null;
        // if no other reference to x exists here
        // x will be deallocated by the garbage collector
	\end{verbatim}
	The second approach uses namespaces. When jumping out from a namespace, every namespace-local variables are unneeded if and only if there are no references from outside. If there are no such references the garbage collector will deallocate these variables:
	\begin{verbatim}
        {
            x = new A();
            ...
            ...
        }
	\end{verbatim}
}

\par{
    \noindent
    The simplest (but most unintelligent) implementation of a dynamic heap allocator is a so-called \textit{bump pointer allocator}. A bump pointer is a pointer which only counts upwards, never downwards. In this case, there is no \texttt{free} to deallocate because it only grows upwards. However, the implementation of \texttt{malloc} is pretty simple and straigh-forward:
    \begin{verbatim}
        void *malloc(int s) {
            LDW 1, 29, 12
            ADD 27, 0, 26
            ADD 26, 26, 1 // R26 = Heap pointer
        }
    \end{verbatim}
    So every time \texttt{malloc} is invoked, these three DLX instructions are executed.
}
