	Each process has its own virtual memory which is loaded whenever a context switch is performed. \textit{Concurrency} (competing for resources, time sharing) $\not=$ \textit{Parallelism} (truely parallel, multiple processors). \textit{Spatial isolation} is necessary to enable concurrency.

			\item{Safety: only accessing memory we have declared, memory access as specified.}

		2 levels where we can have safety:

		\noindent
		Unless all accesses use constants as indices, in general no compiler can perform a range check at compile time. At some point there is a limit. E.g. \texttt{i = 10; a[i];} is recognized by some compilers. \newline
		If you do not allow dynamic allocation, your language does not allow to write a program which accesses memory outside (type and range checks required of course!). \newline
		Suppose a \texttt{free} mechanism: you could free something and access it afterwards, or you could do \texttt{free(obj);} which creates a \textit{dangling pointer}, and do \texttt{obj.field = 1;} afterwards.

				\noindent\underline{Arrays:}
				\begin{lstlisting}[language = C, frame = none]
	int a[3];
				\end{lstlisting}
				The advantage of the contiguous layout in memory: constant time access.\newline
				The big drawback of the contiguous layout in memory: fragmentation. \newline
				3 ingredients of fragmentation:
				\parskip0pt\begin{enumerate}
					\item{contiguously allocated memory gives us constant time access (could be splitted as well)}
					\item{blocks of different size}
					\item{the order of deallocation is not equal to the order of allocation}
				\end{enumerate}
				In the worst case, there is a 50/50 allocation present. If we then want to allocate a big chunk of memory, it is not possible without some reordering.
			}
			\par{
				\noindent\underline{Records:}
				\begin{lstlisting}[language = C, frame = none]
	struct rec {
		int i;
		struct rec *r;
	};
				\end{lstlisting}
				The advantages of the contiguous layout in memory:
				\parskip0pt\begin{itemize}
					\item{constant time access (even faster than the array access because the offsets can be computed at compile time)}
					\item{no fragmentation (if the implementer knows what s/he is doing)}
				\end{itemize}
				The disadvantage is the fact that the access complexity is not constant but linear in the size of the list.
